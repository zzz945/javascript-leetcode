# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Solution

We starts with the widest container, l = 0 and r = n - 1. Let's say the left one is shorter: h[l] < h[r]. 
Then, this is already the largest container the left one can possibly form. There's no need to consider 
it again. Therefore, we just throw it away and start again with l = 1 and r = n -1. In the end, we have got 
the largest containers that each one could form. By comparing them we could get the answer.

```{js}
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
    let max = 0
    let l = 0;
    let r = height.length - 1
    while (l !== r) {
      const lh = height[l]
      const rh = height[r]
      max = Math.max(max, (r - l) * Math.min(lh, rh))
      if (lh > rh) r--
      else l++
    }

    return max
};

console.log(maxArea([1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]))
```
